Collaborative Skill-Based EdTech Network
🌍Context:
Students, professionals, and mentors often struggle to find the right collaborators for learning, building, or mentoring. Skills are scattered across platforms, and there's no unified space to form meaningful, goal-oriented teams in the EdTech space.

🧠Challenge:
Design a platform where users can create skill-based profiles with interests, experiences, and past projects; search and filter other users based on project needs, technologies, or goals; form or join project teams, seek collaborators, or find mentors; enable mentors to browse potential mentees and offer guidance; and optionally integrate features like collaboration boards, feedback systems, and project showcases.

🎯Goal:
To foster a dynamic community that bridges the gap between learners, builders, and mentors by enabling skill-based discovery, collaboration, and growth in one unified platform.
